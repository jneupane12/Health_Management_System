Suppose you are a fitness trainer and nutritionist. You have to deal with three clients, i.e., (John, Jack and Jason). For each client, you have to design their exercise and diet plan.
This app will Create a food log file and an exercise log file for each client.
This program will ask the user whether they want to log or retrieve client data.
It includes a function that takes the user input of the client's name. After the client's name is entered, it will display a message as "What you want to log- Diet or Exercise".
